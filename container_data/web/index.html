Hey there.
If you got to this point, the service is running.

There are two endpoints here:
  /health
    GET this to determine the health of the service. It will reply 200 OK if everything is fine.
  /calc
    POST to this to perform a calculation. It is slow.
    curl --data "2*2" http://localhost/calc
